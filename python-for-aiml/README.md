# Python Basics for AI/ML

This project covers the fundamental Python concepts that are essential for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning development. It serves as a beginner-friendly guide to Python and provides foundational knowledge required to work with advanced AI/ML libraries like NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic Python Syntax**: 
   - Variables, Data Types (int, float, string, etc.)
   - Input/Output
   - Operators
   - Control Structures (if-else, loops)

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
   - List and Dictionary Comprehension

3. **Functions and Modules**:
   - Defining functions
   - `args` and `kwargs`
   - Importing and using modules

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Classes and Objects
   - Inheritance and Polymorphism
   - Encapsulation and Abstraction

5. **Exception Handling**:
   - `try`, `except`, `finally` blocks
   - Raising exceptions

6. **File Handling**:
   - Reading and writing files
   - Working with CSV and text files

7. **Libraries**:
   - Introduction to important AI/ML libraries:
     - NumPy for numerical operations
     - Pandas for data manipulation
     - Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
